#We have to write two scripts. One defines the service itself, the other one contains the workload (what should be done) when the service is started or stopped.
#
# step one - write the service
#
#create your own unit below /lib/systemd/system/my.service
#take a look to 
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Writing_custom_.service_files
# and
# http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html
[Unit]
Description="something usefull in here"
#the service file is a wrapper. the real action is done in the on the following line (should be set with +x)
ConditionPathExists=/my/path/to/the/execute/script
#two example targets below
Before=network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
#we only want to execute a script by the service - fire and forget - one shot only ;-)
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
KillMode=none
Ã¤the following two lines define what should happen when the service is started or stopped
ExecStart=/my/path/to/the/execute/script start
ExecStop=/my/path/to/the/execute/script stop

# step two - write the workscript
