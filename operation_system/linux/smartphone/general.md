# general notes

linux on android is mostly an android kernel with binary blob closed your drivers (e.g. nsa backdoors) where you run your linux on top by using a vnc server.

The nexus 4 and 5 are well supported for native linux.

The nokia n9 is pretty well supported for any meego based or flavored operation system.
Mer is the core of the meego or sailfish os. Nemo is the open source successor of meego.
